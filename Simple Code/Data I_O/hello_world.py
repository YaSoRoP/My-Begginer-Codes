Write a program that displays the text "Hello world!" (without quotes).
Note 1. The checking system will compare the result of your program and 
the correct answer character by character. 
This means that you need to output exactly
the same string that is specified in the task condition.
Note 2. The checking system uses standard output (stdout, print() command).
